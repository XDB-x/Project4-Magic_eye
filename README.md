First version:
Main.py

second version:
main2.py and auto.py

you will get the depth_map.png and the final_autostereogram.png

Final - combined version:

main2.py deep map we think good and main.py the atuostereogram good so we try to combined them together.
And we add the colorful image as texture's basic part.
